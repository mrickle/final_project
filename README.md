# final_project
## Selected topic and reasoning
We chose the topic of football win totals based on previous season hisotrical data. We chose this to see if we could use multiple linear regression analysis that is close to the predicted win O/U win totals presented by Vegas casinos before the start of the regular NFL season.
## Source
We will be collecting historical team data as well as betting data from the previous season and uploading into an excel file and creating SQL database tables. in these tables will be based on the previous season win totals, headcoach return, total offensive ranking, total defensive ranking, Team QBR rating, OC remains, and DC remains
## Questions we hope to answer
We hope to answer the question of what goes into the over/under totals that are given to teams. We want to know what the most important factor on if a team can be good or if a bad over under total can spark a team to a better record then was projected. and most importantly do these metrics lead to a team being over the projected total.
## Communication Protocols
For communication we have created a slack channel (final_project) where we will be sharing updates made to the Git Hub repositorie as well as any questions about the data we are looking to present. We also work together during our Monday Wednesday classes with any questions and/or next steps in the building process. Finally we are updated via email with changes branch merges that have taken place from our individual branches to the main branch
